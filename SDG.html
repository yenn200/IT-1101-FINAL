			<h1>SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth, what is it and why is it so important?</h1>
			<p>SDG 8 understands that inclusive and sustained economic growth can drive progress,</br>
 create decent jobs for all and improve living standards. To achieve this, among other</br>
 measures, the UN considers it necessary that a number of mandates be implemented to</br>
 maintain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and to</br>
 achieve GDP growth of at least 7 % per year in the least developed countries, or to achieve</br>
 higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and</br>
 innovation. This includes focusing on high value-added sectors. It also sees the need to</br>
 progressively improve the efficient production and consumption of the world's resources and</br>
 to seek to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.</br></br> 

This is one of the SDGs that has suffered a major setback due to the confluence of several</br>
 economic and geopolitical crises, in addition to the pandemic caused by COVID-19. According</br>
 to the World Labour Organisation, low-income countries and regions in Africa and the Arab</br>
 States are unlikely to recover to pre-pandemic levels of unemployment by 2023. The United</br>
 Nations therefore developed a roadmap for a socio-economic response to the recent crises</br>
 to support countries on their path to social and economic recovery, thereby making</br>
 development more sustainable and the global economy more resilient to future shocks.</br></br>

Eradicating poverty will only be possible through stable and well-paid jobs. Furthermore,</br>
 according to its latest Sustainable Development Goals Report (2023), meeting SDG 8 will</br>
 also require deep reform of the financial system to address rising debt, economic uncertainty</br>
 and trade tensions, while promoting fair pay and decent work for young people. This will</br>
 promote sustained, sustainable and inclusive economic growth, such as that generated</br>
 by green jobs.</br></br>

According to the United Nations, globally, the number of jobs needed between 2016 and 2030,</br>
 just for people entering the labour market to keep pace with the growth of the world's working-</br>
age population, is 470 million. This represents about 30 million jobs per year. Moreover, these</br>
 jobs must be decent, i.e., productive work that provides a fair income, safety in the workplace</br>
 and social protection for families, while offering better prospects for personal development</br>
 and social integration.</br></br>


The 7 % GDP growth target for the least developed countries had not been reached before</br>
 the pandemic. In fact the actual GDP growth rate per capita was 2 % in 2018 (the same level as</br>
 the average annual growth rate between 2010 and 2018). In 2021, after the huge collapse</br>
 caused by the coronavirus crisis, the global growth rate rebounded to 5 %, only to decelerate to</br>
 2.2 % in 2022. The growth rate is expected to decline further to 1.6 % in 2024</br></br>. 

Another object of study by the UN was the situation of informal employment, which refers to</br>
 jobs that are not registered, regulated or protected by legal or regulatory frameworks, whether</br>
 paid or unpaid. According to the organisation, this had slowly declined between 2015 and 2019,</br>
 but confinement and containment measures during the COVID-19 pandemic led to large job</br>
 losses for informal workers, particularly women.</br></br> 

In 2022, the share of people in informal employment was 58 %, corresponding to about 2</br>
 billion people in precarious jobs with no social protection. Regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa</br>
 and Central and South Asia continue to have high rates of informality, with 87.2 % and 84.8 %</br>
 respectively.</br></br>

As for the unemployment rate, the ILO (International Labour Organisation) reports that in 2022</br>
 it stood at 5.8 % globally from a peak of 6.9 % in 2020, lower than the pre-pandemic level of 5.5</br>
 % in 2019. Global unemployment is projected to remain at 5.8 % until 2024, with almost 211</br>
 million people unemployed. Again, however, this is very uneven by region, with low-income</br>
 countries unlikely to see declines in unemployment. Moreover, young people aged 15-24</br>
 continue to face great difficulties in finding decent employment and the global youth</br>
 unemployment rate is much higher than that of adults aged 25 and over.</br></br> 

Facing the current situation and reversing the trend that these data reflect has become a</br>
 primary objective at the international level. This is why promoting decent, inclusive and</br>
 sustainable work became SDG 8 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, approved in</br>
 September 2015 as part of 2030 Agenda.
